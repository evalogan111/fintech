                            requirement but a cornerstone of business integrity and reputation. For fintech businesses

                        <p>AML/CTF compliance refers to the set of laws, regulations, and procedures designed to prevent

                            laundering), and from financing terrorist activities (terrorism financing). These
                            regulations require businesses, particularly in the financial sector, to monitor, report,
                            and prevent such activities.</p>
